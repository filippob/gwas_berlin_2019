## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data <- fread("dogs_imputed.raw")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
X <- data[,-c(1,2)]
G <- gMatrix::gAstleBalding.2(X)
```


```{r}
heatmap(G)
```

```{r}
data.scal <- cmdscale(as.dist(G), k=3, eig=TRUE)
```
